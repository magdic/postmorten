All of these files work if the points below are folowed!

  *All files must be kept in the same directory
  
  *A database must exist called `loginTut` and must be accessable by the connection credentials -
      
      - Hostname: Localhost
      - Username: root
      - Password: '' (this is nothing)
      
   if not you need to change the connection information accordingly in each file
   
  *Your server must have PHP and MySQL installed to use these files
  
Best of luck
